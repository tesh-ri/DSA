🔍 What is Binary Search?
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search range in half and eliminates half the possibilities at each step.

✅ Binary Search Key Concepts
-Works only on sorted arrays

-Time complexity: O(log n)

-Space complexity: O(1) (iterative), O(log n) (recursive stack)


int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
  int left = 0, right = n - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

    if (arr[mid] == target)
      return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < target)
      left = mid + 1;
    else
      right = mid - 1;
  }

  return -1; // not found
}
